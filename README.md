## Data preparation

### CUB-200

1. Download the dataset [CUB-200-2011](https://www.vision.caltech.edu/datasets/cub_200_2011/) 
from https://data.caltech.edu/records/20098 (1.1 GB).
2. Extract `CUB_200_2011.tgz` in the `datasets` folder.
3. Download the image masks from https://data.caltech.edu/records/20097
4. Extract it in `datasets/CUB-200-2011`

#### CUB-200 artificial confound

Run the following command to add the synthetic confound to the first five classes.

```bash
python data_preprocessing.py --seed 0 bird -i datasets/CUB_200_2011 --classes 001 002 003 004 005
```

The data pipeline performs the following operations:
 1. Crop the images using information from `bounding_boxes.txt` (included in the dataset)
 2. Split the cropped images into training and test sets, using `train_test_split.txt` (included in the dataset)
 3. Put the cropped training images in the directory `./datasets/cub200_cropped/train_cropped/`
 4. Put the cropped test images in the directory `./datasets/cub200_cropped/test_cropped/`
 5. Augment the training set and create an augmented training set in `./datasets/cub200_cropped/train_cropped_augmented/`
 6. Add artificial confound (colored box) on three classes

#### CUB-200 natural confound

```bash
python data_preprocessing.py cub200_shuffled_bg
./copy_top_20.sh
```

The scripts, in addition to the operations from 1 to 5 in the previous section,
change the backgrounds of the test set images by shifting the background of one class to
the next one (e.g., the background of class 1 becomes the background of class 2).
A the end of the process, the modified images are placed in the directory 
`./datasets/cub200_cropped/test_cropped_shuffled`.

At the end of the data preparation, you should have the following structure 
in the `dataset` folder

```
./datasets/
   cub200_cropped/
      clean_5_classes/
         ...
      clean_top_20/
         ...
      confound_artificial/
         ...
```

### COVID datasets

Data processing of the COVID data set is based on the code of the paper 
"[_AI for radiographic COVID-19 detection selects shortcuts over signal_](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.13.20193565)".
Follow the instruction in the README.md of the repository https://github.com/suinleelab/cxr_covid.
Use the scripts `make_csv_bimcv_negative.py ` and `make_h5.py` of this repository 
instead of the ones in the original repository. 
Put the resulting `*.h5` in the corresponding folders in the `datasets/covid` folder.

Only a subset of the data has been used, see the following list of which parts have been downloaded:

- _ChestX-ray14_: `images_001.tar.gz`, `images_002.tar.gz`
- _GitHub-COVID_: the complete repository
- _PadChest_: `0.zip`
- _BIMCV-COVID+_: `bimcv_covid19_posi_subjects_<1-10>.tgz`

```
./datasets/
   covid/
      ChestX-ray14/
         ...
      GitHub-COVID/
         ...
      PadChest/
         ...
      bimcv+/
         ...
```

## Running

### Training

Configurations are managed by [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) and a basic tutorial 
can be found [here](https://hydra.cc/docs/tutorials/basic/your_first_app/simple_cli/).
The structure of the configuration is  in `settings.py`, which contains the default values.
The actual hyperparameters used for each experiment are in the `conf` folder.

Run `main.py` passing the following arguments: 

- `experiment_name=<<NAME_OF_THE_EXPERIMENT>>` choose an experiment name
- `+experiment=natural_base` load a configuration file from the `conf` directory

Example:

```bash
python main.py experiment_name=firstExperiment +experiment=natural_base
```

You can override the loaded configuration values from the command line. For instance,

```bash
python main.py experiment_name=firstExperiment +experiment=natural_base epochs=30
```

To see the current configuration

```bash
python main.py --cfg job
```

The experiments can be tracked on [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/). To enable this
feature, add `wandb=true` to the command line when running the script.


## Evaluation

```bash
./plot.sh <PATH-TO-MODEL> "<LIST-OF-CLASSES>"
```

Substitute `PATH-TO-MODEL` with the path to the model you want to analyze.
Specify the list of (0-based) index of the classes to use for the evaluation 
(Cub200: "0 8 14 6 15", Covid dataset: "0 1").

The script performs the following operations:
  - plot the statistics of the experiment;
  - plot the prototypes projected at the same epoch of the supplied model;
  - find the nearest patches to each prototype
  - plot a grid of the nearest patches


## Reproducibility

### Experiment 1

```bash
./run_artificial_confound.sh
```

***
### Experiment 2

#### ProtoPDebug

Since human intervention is required in the debugging loop, follow these steps to run _ProtoPDebug_:

1. **First round**, without any human supervision

   ```bash
   python main.py experiment_name=\"first_round\" +experiment=natural_base
   ```

2. Give **supervision** to the learned prototypes.

      _a)_ find the nearest patches to each prototype, substitute `<PATH-TO-MODEL>` with the
      path to the model of the previous round

      ```bash
      python global_analysis.py <PATH-TO-MODEL>
      ```
   
      _b)_ manually select the patches that represent the confounds you want to forbid

      ```bash
      python extract_confound.py interactive <PATH-TO-MODEL> -classes 0 8 14 6 15 -n-img 10
      ```
   
      Only the prototypes of the specified classes are presented for the debugging step.
      (See main paper for the details on how have been selected these 5 classes).
      The command extracts the most activated patches from the most activate images of
      each prototype associated to the 5 classes.
      For each patch, you will have to choose one of these options:
      - `y` (yes) the prototype activation overlays _exclusively (or very nearly so) the background_.
         The activation cut-out is added to the _forbidden concepts_
      - `n` (next) the prototype activation overlays _some part of the bird_. 
        No action is performed and go to the next patch
      - `r` (remember) the prototype activation overlays some part of the bird and the concept
        is added to the concepts to be _remembered_ (useful when you use the remembering loss).
      
      The cut-out of the selected patched are placed in two folders `tmp_forbidden_conf` and `tmp_remember_patch`,
      inside the experiment folder.
      The patches from the images selected with _y_ or _r_ must be extracted manually 
      and saved in the same folder.
      
      _c)_ move the patches in the dataset folder

      ```bash
      python extract_confound.py move <PATH-TO-MODEL-FOLDER>
      ```
      The script takes the patches in `tmp_forbidden_conf` and `tmp_remember_patch` (the
      filenames must contain class, prototype and image id formatted like `c=0_p=1_i=2.png`)
      and adds them to `datasets/cub200_cropped/clean_top_20/forbidden_prototypes` and 
      `datasets/cub200_cropped/clean_top_20/remembering_prototypes` respectively.

3. **Subsequent rounds**, with the supervision on the confounds. The training will start
   from the model of the previous round by substituting 
   `<<PATH_TO_MODEL>>` with the path to the saved model of the previous round.

   ```bash
   python main.py experiment_name=\"second_round\" +experiment=natural_aggregation debug.path_to_model=\"<<PATH_TO_MODEL>>\"
   ```

4. Go back to 2) and repeat.


#### IAIA-BL, ProtoPNet clean, ProtoPNet

Run:

```bash
./run_natural_confound.sh
```

***
### Experiment 3

Follow the same steps of Experiment 2

First round:
```bash
python main.py experiment_name=first_round +experiment=covid_base
```

Subsequent rounds:

```bash
python main.py experiment_name=\"second_round\"
                    +experiment=covid_aggregation
                    debug.path_to_model=\"<PATH_TO_MODEL>\"
```
